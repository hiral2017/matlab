a = 3
% Creating multiple variable or matrix
b = [4, 0, 2; 1, 2, 3]
%b is Same as c below

e=' world'
f=strcat(d,e)
%num2str converts numerical value to a string
g = num2str(eps)
h = num2str(pi)
%Use ' for transpose of matrix, eg.
b'
%If you put semicoluns at the end of the line,Matlab doesn't print the output in the command window
%which is helpful for long/complicated codes.
